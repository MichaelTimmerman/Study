# Section 1 Core Concepts
## Master & Worker Nodes
- Master Node: Manage, Plan, Schedule, Monitor nodes
- Worker Nodes: Host applications as containers
## Master Nodes
### ETCD
HA Key value store
### Controller-manager
* kube-scheduler: Identifies the right node to place a container on a node based on conditions (capacity, policies, constraints...)
* node-controller: Manages the creation of new nodes or handling damaged nodes / other situations
* replication-controller: Manages that the desired amount of containers are actually running on the cluster
### Kube-api server
* Orchestrating all Kubernetes operations within the Cluster
* Exposes the main API (used by external users, controllers and worker nodes)
## Container Runtime Engines (Docker, ...)
* Everything runs in containers, therefore we need Docker installed on master & worker nodes
## Worker Nodes
### Kubelet
Agent that runs on each node on the cluster, listens for instructions from the Kube API server and deploys, destroys containers on the node as required. Kube API server monitors (by periodically polling information) states of nodes via the Kubelet. 
### Kube-proxy
Component that runs on each worker node to allow network traffic between different worker nodes.

## ETCD
* Distributed reliable key-value store that is simple, secure and fast
* Example commands: `set key1 value1`, `get key1`
* Stores information about: nodes, pods, configs, secrets, accounts, roles, bindings, Others
